                <li class="square-list"><b>Watering:</b>In Gujarat's semi-arid climate, water spinach regularly to
                    keep the soil moist, especially during dry spells. Avoid overwatering to prevent fungal diseases
                    and root rot.</li>
                <li class="square-list">Soil Enrichment: Add organic compost or well-rotted manure before planting
                    to enhance soil fertility and structure. This supports healthy plant growth, especially in
                    Gujarat's slightly alkaline soils.</li>
                <li class="square-list">Crop Rotation:Rotate spinach with other crops each season to maintain soil
                    nutrients and reduce pest and disease risks. Avoid planting after other leafy vegetables to
                    prevent soil depletion.</li>

                                harmful insects common in Gujarat's warm climate. Regularly inspect for pests like aphids and
                                remove affected leaves.</li>

                            <li class="square-list">In Gujarat, plant spinach from October to February, as it
                                thrives in cooler winter months. Avoid the hot summer months from March to June,
                                when high temperatures can cause bolting.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li class="square-list">Spinach is versatile and can be used in various dishes such as
                                palak paneer, curries, soups, smoothies, and salads. Its mild flavor blends well
                                with other ingredients, making it a staple in Indian cuisine. Additionally, spinach
                                is rich in vitamins and minerals, adding nutritional value to meals.</li>

                            <li class="square-list">Spinach prefers well-drained, loamy soil enriched with organic
                                compost to support healthy growth. In Gujarat, slightly sandy soils can be improved
                                with compost to retain moisture.</li>
                            <li class="square-list">Optimal pH:Maintain a pH between 6.5 and 7.0 for optimal
                                nutrient availability. Gujarat soils may lean towards alkaline, so adding compost
                                helps balance the pH.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li class="square-list">Sow seeds 1/2 inch deep in rows spaced 12-18 inches apart to
                                give the plants enough room to grow. Lightly cover the seeds with soil and water
                                gently to settle them in place.</li>

                            <li class="square-list">Apply mulch around plants to retain soil moisture, suppress
                                weeds, and regulate soil temperature. Organic mulch like straw or shredded leaves
                                also adds nutrients to the soil as it breaks down.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li class="square-list">Keep the soil moist but not soggy by watering regularly,
                                especially during dry periods typical in Gujarat. Deep watering encourages strong
                                root development, while shallow watering can lead to weak plants.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li class="square-list">Spinach is ready for harvest 35-45 days after sowing. Harvest
                                leaves when they are large enough to eat, typically when they reach about 3-4 inches
                                in length.</li>
                            <li class="square-list">For continuous harvesting, pick the outer leaves first, allowing
                                the inner leaves to continue growing. Alternatively, you can harvest the entire
                                plant at once if desired. Regular harvesting encourages new growth and extends the
                                season.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li class="square-list">Sow seeds 1/2 inch deep in rows 12-18 inches apart, ensuring
                                even spacing for optimal growth.</li>
                            <li class="square-list">Thin seedlings to 6 inches apart once they sprout to prevent
                                overcrowding and improve air circulation.</li>
                            <li class="square-list">Mulch to retain soil moisture, reduce weed growth, and maintain
                                even soil temperature, which is essential for healthy spinach growth</li>
